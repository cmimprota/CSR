# Folder for storing (cut)) vocabularies

- This folder is just a storage folder.
- Should not contain any scripts
- Files are generated by `vocab_building/vocab_builder.py`; cf `vocab_building/README.md`
- `pickle_vocab.py` and `unpickle_vocab.py` can be used to go from .txt to .pkl. In principle we can use pickle only. When a script "takes a vocabulary file as input", this refers to .pkl files.
