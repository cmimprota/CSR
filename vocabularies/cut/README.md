# Folder for storing transformed vocabularies

- This folder is just a storage folder.
- Should not contain any scripts
- All files can be generated multiple times by scripts from **cuttings** using different **full** vocabularies and parameters
- `pickle_vocab.py` and `unpickle_vocab.py` can be used to go from .txt to .pkl. In principle we can use pickle only. When a script "takes a vocabulary file as input", this refers to .pkl files.
