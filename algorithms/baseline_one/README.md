# DATA PREPROCESSING
Currently there is left space and TODO inserted where we expect data preprocessing.
The preprocessing should be inserted in the vocabulary as well. 
There should not be a mismatch between vocabulary and training data and that
is why we need to include it in both places

# CODE EXPLANATION
Every class is fully annotated. Please start by reading bow_train.py.
It will navigate you through the code so that you can fully understand
the BOW approach and what kind of algorithm this encoding imposes.
Then continue with the bow_model.py and finally finish with bow_test.py

# OTHER POSSIBLE APPROACHES
- Use a different ANN structure with more hidden layers
- Try on a cluster with a full dataset
- Try using sigmoid and BCELoss instead
