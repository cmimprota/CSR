## Usage

TODO, but essentially it's the same thing as the other stages

Example:
```bash
python word_embedd_building/as_script.py --method trivial vocab_building/results/noop_train_pos_dummy/top-k-freq_500.txt data_preprocessing/results/preprocessed__noop/train_neg.txt
# look for the output file at word_embedd_building/results/<timestamp>/trivial.npy
```
